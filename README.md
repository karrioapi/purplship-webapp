# purplship-webapp

purplship-server is an On-prem or cloud Multi-carrier Shipping API. The server is in Python, but you can use any 
programming language to send API requests to any supported shipping carriers (Canada Post, DHL, FedEx, UPS, Purolator...), 
from your application.

**This project hosts the webapp client code. Please file issues at [/purplship-server](https://github.com/purplship/purplship-server),
